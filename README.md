## Build

### Generate build

You can generate a build of this project with the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```

### Specify MeiliSearch's server URL

⚠️ By default, the application will call MeiliSearch at the exact same address as it is running.
Example: if your app is running at `http://localhost:5000`, it will try to call `http://localhost:5000/indexes` to retrieve the list of your indexes.

If you want to specify the URL where your MeiliSearch is running, use the `REACT_APP_MEILI_SERVER_ADDRESS` environment variable.

Example:

```bash
REACT_APP_MEILI_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:7700 yarn build
```

or

```bash
REACT_APP_MEILI_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:7700 npm run build
```

### Run your build

The above commands will generate an optimized version of the app, inside the `build` folder.

You can then serve it with any web server of your choice.

Example:

```bash
serve build
```

## Storybook

Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively test components.
